  <h3>now that you've seen my professional work, here are a few things about my personal projects</h3>
  <p>My goal is to use technology to make art that makes people question the way they use that technology. I want to make controversial statements that get people talking; not art that tells people what stance I think they should take on an issue. I want
    to contribute to the design of interfaces and the infrastructure of databases used to connect people and to share user-generated content.</p>

  <p>I will use my cross-disciplinary background in art and science to contribute to culturally powerful future projects. I have worked in multiple science labs across different universities, and have run experiments, collected data, and applied the scientific
    method. I have also worked in interdisciplinary computing in art labs where I created visualizations of cultural data. I aim to investigate human cognition through the creation of art generated from cultural databases and analyze the data to reveal
    trends. </p>

  <p>It is said that less is more. You can also use more to say a lot less. Use forms of commercialized media to say something or nothing at all. Make art that is rich; rich with meaning, or rich with nothingness. Use means of pop-media and ads for artistic
    ends.
  </p>

  <p>Pose cognitive inquiries; question the inner workings of the mind and question people's reasoning. Model the biological; examine cognition and consciousness. Look at how experience influences perspective and how individuals make meaning of new experiences.
    Use scientific methods for artistic purposes. Bring the laboratory to the gallery and museum. Experiment with new mediums and combinations of techniques.</p>

  <p>Visualize data with powerful info graphics, and make art that is influenced or created by data from dynamic processes. Art can be passively interactive, through creating art with user activity. It does not have to be done in real-time, but in some circumstances
    is more interesting.</p>

  <p>Templates are often frowned upon, but remember: Wordpress is better than no press. Just get art out into the world, don't dwell on the means by which this happens. Controversial is better than boring, so do not hold back in fear of offending someone.
    Make art that is current; art that is relevant. Make art just for the hell of it. Transcend boundaries between art and research. Fuse new forms of media and academic disciplines to generate artistic expression. Question and critique cultural movements.
    Make scientific art, and artistic science. Support the fusion of disciplines and cross-disciplinary collaboration.</p>

  <p>With ever-changing surroundings, our role in the world will continue to adapt to technological advancements. New media affords new ways of communicating old ideas. Whether your experiences are virtual, augmented, real, or dreamt, they shape the way
    you view the world, a view that is constantly changing.</p>

  <p>And here are my CONCLUSIONS (based on The Manifesto of the Futurist Painters by Graphica Obscura) resolute and in a nutshell. With my enthusiastic adherence to digital new media art I aim to:</p>

  <p>MAKE SMART ART!</p>

  <p>BECOME A SMARTIST!</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>Collaborate with scientists.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>Visualize data.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span></span>Program artificial intelligence through machine-learning algorithms. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span> Analyze user-generated content, and evaluate user-interaction to learn </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span> about user-cognition,
    workflow, and preference.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span></span>Look at the user's navigation path to better understand </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span> cognitive processes.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>Make art that pushes people to question their stance on an issue and form </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span> an opinion.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>Make art that brings the back-end process to the front-end;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span> makes the opaque
    transparent.
  </p>


  <p>Question</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>What</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>Where</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>How</p>


  <p>Is it</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>Better</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>Faster</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span>Stronger</p>


  <p>How can new technologies be used<span></span>
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span></span> to question their function?</p>

  <p>Can people participate?</p>

  <p>Why should they care? </p>


  <p> Out with the old and the overplayed! Let the future be swept clean of stagnation and embrace re-mix! Make way for the controversialists, the bold, the righteous!</p>
